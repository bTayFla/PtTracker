<h1>Installing PtTracker</h1>
1. Save files in your ProfitTrailer Folder. (Same folder as application.properties)<br>
2. Open PtTracker.json in a text editor, add your username, license key, details, and then save.
(Note: Your license key has single user access. If you give it to someone else, your tracker will no longer work.)<br>
3. (skip this step if you want to run your own local webserver) <a href="https://cesanta.com/binary.html">Download Mongoose (Windows)</a> and place the .exe file in the same folder.

<h1>Running PtTracker using Mongoose (Windows) </h1>

Open Mongoose (exe file) in your ProfitTrailer folder.<br>
(Mongoose is a standalone web server. Block port 8084 in your firewall for security)

<h1>Running PtTracker using your own web server (Any OS)</h1>

Configure your webserver to serve your ProfitTrailer folder as webroot directory locally.<br>
Access with: http://localhost/PtTracker.html<br>
If you decide to serve it publicly to view PtTracker remotely, make sure you add an <a href="http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/">htaccess file</a> for security.
